## Project Description
The **Car Rental System** is a database-driven project designed to manage car bookings, customers, and rental durations efficiently. The system ensures accurate tracking of car availability, calculates rental costs based on booking durations, and provides insights into frequently rented cars. 

The system leverages **SQL** and **PL/SQL** to handle complex database operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency across all transactions.

## Features
- **Car Bookings Management**: 
  - Facilitates smooth booking operations for customers.
  - Tracks real-time car availability and updates automatically after bookings.
- **Customer Data Management**: 
  - Maintains customer details for efficient service.
- **Rental Cost Calculation**: 
  - Implements PL/SQL functions to calculate rental costs based on booking duration.
- **Frequently Rented Cars Analysis**: 
  - SQL queries to identify cars with the highest demand.
- **Triggers for Availability Updates**: 
  - Ensures car availability is updated automatically after bookings are completed.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) 
  - For database querying and management.
- **PL/SQL** (Procedural Language/SQL) 
  - For stored procedures, triggers, and complex calculations.

## Key Database Tasks
1. **Identify Frequently Rented Cars**:
   - SQL queries to generate reports on the most popular cars in the system.
2. **Update Car Availability**:
   - Triggers to ensure car status is updated automatically post-booking.
3. **Calculate Rental Costs**:
   - PL/SQL functions to calculate total charges based on the rental duration and rates.
